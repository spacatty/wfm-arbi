# TODO

- **Watch module (arbitrage)**  
  Add a Watch feature for the two arbitrage tables (Rank Value + Reroll Value): watchlist of auctions, server-side polling at configurable interval (start/stop from Watch dashboard), goal = catch player online and/or price changes. Include browser notifications when changes are detected. Do not implement until requested.
